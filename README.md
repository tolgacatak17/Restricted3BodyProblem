# Restricted 3-Body Problem

This repository contains a project for the **Computer Applications (ME303)** course at **Bogazici University**, Mechanical Engineering Department. This project investigates the motion of a small body under the influence of two massive orbiting bodies using the **Euler's method**, the **Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4)** method, and MATLAB's built-in **ode45** function.

## Problem Description

The **Restricted 3-Body Problem** models the motion of a negligible-mass third body (e.g., a spacecraft) under the gravitational influence of two larger orbiting bodies (e.g., Earth and Moon). The two massive bodies are assumed to move in circular orbits around their center of mass, while the third body moves within their gravitational field without influencing their orbits.

### Assumptions
1. The motion is restricted to a plane (2D motion).
2. The masses of the larger bodies are normalized:
   - **m<sub>1</sub> = μ**: The smaller massive body (e.g., Moon) with **μ = 0.012277471**.
   - **m<sub>2</sub> = 1 − μ**: The larger massive body (e.g., Earth) with **1 − μ = 0.987722529 = μ\***.
3. The distance between the two large bodies is normalized to 1.

## Mathematical Model

The motion of the third body is governed by the following equations of motion in a rotating reference frame with the center of mass at the origin:

</p>

Here, **y<sub>1</sub>(t)** and **y<sub>2</sub>(t)** represent the position of the third body.

### Initial Conditions

The initial conditions for the system are defined as:

</p>

### Time Period

The time period for the simulation is defined as:

</p>

However, different time periods can be used to understand the trajectory better.

### First-Order Differential Equations

To solve the system numerically, the equations of motion are converted into a system of first-order differential equations:

</p>

Then, the system becomes as follows:

## Example Solution

The following trajectory is obtained by solving the system using different methods and time steps:

- **Euler's method**: Time step of **h = T/24000**.
- **RK4 method**: Time step of **h = T/6000**.
